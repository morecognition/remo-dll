**Introduction**

Remo DLL is a repository which contains a dll project that can be used to communicate with a REMO device. Another part of this repository is a simple windows forms based application named Data_Recorder which can be used to test the DLL and stream real time data from REMO. The streamed data is also stored within the working directory of the application.
